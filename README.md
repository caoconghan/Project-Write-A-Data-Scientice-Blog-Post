# Installation
No need to install additional libraries other than Python integrated in Anaconada.The code should run using Python 3.* .
# Project Motivation
For this project,I used Stack Overflow Data from 2017 to better understand :
1. To developers, what are *the most important benifit* other than base salary ? 
2. If some of the individuals might have bias of the most important benifits towards their own *degrees* ?
3. If some of the individuals might have bias of the most important benifits towards their *gender* ?
4. What factors about an individual contributed to *StackOverflowSatisfaction* ?
5. What factors about an individual contributed to *ExpectedSalary* ?
#  File Descriptions
There are 3 notebooks here to showcase work related to above question. The notebook title indicates the above question to be answered. Eache of the notebooks was trying to give the answer though analyzing the data. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
There are several additional `.py` which are from the course owned by Udacuty are help to analyze data and answer the questions above.
# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_19a399df20102yj8h.html).
